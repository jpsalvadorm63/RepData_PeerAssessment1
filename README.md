W1 Project
==========

Hi ! This is the project for week 1, for properly evaluate it I assume you already has insalled **<code>R</code>**, **<code>git</code>** and **<code>RStudio</code>** in your laptop, desktop or workstation. I'm also asumming that you will **clone the project**.

If you don't want to clone the whole project, it's enough if you bring and run **PA1_template.Rmd**, but be prepared because it automatically will download ZIP file, unzip it ang get the **activity.csv** file

Evaluation of Assignment
========================

To properly evaluate my project please fallow this instructions:

1. select an existing working directory where to clone my project
2. from the command line execute the git command:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/jpsalvadorm63/rrw1project</pre>

3. a new sub-directory has been created <code>rrw1project</code>. Please move there
(use command <code>cd rrw1project</code>) where you will find all files for evaluatng the project.
4. you will find some <code>.R</code>, <code>.Rmd</code>, <code>.html</code> and <code>.csv</code> files. The most important are:

|                           file | content                                                       |
| -----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **<code>PA1_template.Rmd</code>** | the R markdown file to be evaluated                        |
| **<code>README.md</code>**       | this file, the one you are reading now !                    |

5. Start RStudio
6. Open file <code>PA1_template.Rmd</code>
7. Press button <code>Previe HTML</code>
8. It's in your hands now, please review carefully the results. A new <code>PA1_template.html</code>
has been generated. You don't need to open it as RStudio will automatically show the content in your screen.

Those 8 steps should be enaugh to review the projects.

You can find aditional <code>.R</code> and <code>.Rmd</code> files refered to the "full submission" part of the project in same name subdir,
you may view and review them, but I don't think they are part of evaluation process:

+ <code>full_submission.R</code> the full submission part of project in R

+ <code>full_submission.Rmd</code> the full submission part of project as R markdown file

*I let you know that I didn't clone the original Rogger D. Peng repository*, I thought it was
not necesary as I was able to create a project from the scratch. All files to be reviewed are delivered
accordind to the project asignments.

**about the <code>figure</code> directory !!**

When running <code>PA1_template.Rmd</code> it is automatically created the <code>PA1_template_files</code> and its subdirectory <code>figure-html</code>
where the figures are saved or overwritten.

the directory <code>figure</code> is just a manual copy of all generated graphic files from <code>PA1_template_files/figure-html</code>.
